# **Welcome!**
## What is a tweak?
Well, in the most simplest terms, a tweak allows us to modify our ios device, wether it's changing the colour of the date on the lock screen, allowing the icons to float about, or adding a control centre toggle that reboots the device: anything is possible. 

For these lessons, I will **not** expect you to know any code, but that you are **jailbroken** (I will be using [Odyssey](https://theodyssey.dev]) but feel free to use other jailbreak tools such as [checkra1n](https://checkra.in)) and that you have a few GB of storage to spare.
